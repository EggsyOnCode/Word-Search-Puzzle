# Word-Search-Puzzle
Input a list of strings which are randomly stored in a user-defined grid and obfuscated. Your Task? Find those bloody strings!

How it Works?
The User inputs a list of strings to be put into a grid. The strings are randomly placed in the grid and the unoccupied coordinates are filled with randomly generated small alphabets. 

This obfuscates the inputted strings and the user's task is to find them in the grid. 

The strings may be stored top to bottom, bottom to top, right to left or left to right; in these 4 directions in the grid. 

Updates and Additional features are underway!
